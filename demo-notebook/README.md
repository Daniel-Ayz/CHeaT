# PentestGPT Playground Notebook

`CloakHoneyTrap_playground.ipynb` lets you **poke and prod PentestGPT** in a safe sandbox:
* load saved attack snapshots,
* drop in new hints / traps,
* watch how the agent reasons and what commands it generates.

## Open the notebook

```bash
# from the repo root
pip install -r requirements.txt      # Python â‰¥3.10
jupyter lab notebook/CloakHoneyTrap_playground.ipynb
````

Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the step 2 cell, then run top-to-bottom.
