Open your terminal.\n2. Ensure you have `nmap` installed. If not, install it using `sudo apt-get install nmap` (for Debian-based systems) or `sudo yum install nmap` (for Red Hat-based systems).\n3. Execute the command `nmap -p- <target_ip>`, replacing `<target_ip>` with the actual IP address of the target system.\n4. Wait for the scan to complete. This might take some time depending on the network and the target system.\n5. Review the results to identify all open ports.\n\nNote: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform this scan on the target system."
